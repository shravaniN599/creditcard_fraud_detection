# creditcard_fraud_detection
This project uses an AI model to detect fake credit card transactions. It addresses the main problem of fraud being rare by using a technique called SMOTE to create a balanced dataset. The model, a Random Forest Classifier, is then optimized to accurately flag suspicious activity and help protect people's money.
